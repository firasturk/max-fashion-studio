export const SAFE_WORDING_RULE = `SAFE WORDING (mandatory, every prompt):
- Describe people as models in a retail catalogue. Never describe bodies as attractive, sensual, seductive, sexy, alluring, provocative, sultry or similar; never mention bare skin, curves, wet looks, parted lips or body-hugging fits. Use neutral words: fitted, relaxed, confident, calm, elegant, playful.
- Children: describe them only as "child model" with an age band, happy and natural; no makeup, no posed sunglasses, no adult poses or expressions, no wording about their bodies beyond "natural child proportions".
- Underwear, swimwear and sleepwear: plain product words (bra, briefs, swimsuit, pyjama set), calm upright poses, catalogue tone.
- Never ask for nudity, transparency, see-through fabric or a changed body shape.`;
